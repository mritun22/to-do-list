## Project Overview

A simple To-do list is implemented with vanilla **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** technologies.  
Using a responsive 3-column flexbox layout, the page is styled to display **Adding Task**, **Pending Tasks** and **Completed Tasks** sections. With the help of **JS Events** and **DOM Manipulation**, a user is able to add a task, get a list of pending tasks and lastly, mark them done and get a list of completed tasks.
